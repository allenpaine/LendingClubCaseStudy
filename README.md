# Project Name
> Lending Club Case Study Assignment

## Table of Contents
* [General Info]
- We are trying to evaluate applicants' creditworthiness by analyzing multiple valiables.
- This is part of Lending club case study project.
- Dataset is provided by UPGRAD that has more than 100 columns and about 40000 rows.

* [Technologies Used]
> We used Pandas, Numpy, matplotlib and Seaborn libraries to analyze the data
- pandas - version 1.3.4
- numpy - version 1.20.3
- matplot - version 3.4.3
- seaborn - version 0.11.2
* [Conclusions]
- Lending Club should scale back its high interest loans with a 60 month repayment term
since they are more likely to default.
- Small business loans default more frequently.
- People are more likely to file bankruptcy if they have more publicly available negative records.
- Grades are one of the reliable indicators of defaultors. Before giving loans to low grade(G to A) borrowers,
Lending Club should investigate more about them.

* [Acknowledgements]
- This project was based on EDA by UPGRAD.
